# Tools for Network Analysis

This repository contains tools, libraries and applications to analyze network measurements.

_Disclaimer: This is not an officially supported Jigsaw product._


> **Experimental code.** We may break you. Please let us know if you are using this code.

## Installation

netanalysis is not in PyPI.  Instead you can install straight from our Github repository:

`pip install git+git://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/net-analysis.git@master`

On a `Pipfile`, you can do:

```
[packages]
netanalysis = {git = "git://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/net-analysis.git", ref = "master"}
```

You should specify a version tag or a commit if the `master` branch breaks you.


## Tutorials

### Analyze DNS Measurements

[Analyze DNS Queries](netanalysis/analysis/analyze_dns.md) describes how to fetch data from OONI and check for interference.

[netanalysis/dns/analysis/DomainAnalysis.ipynb](netanalysis/dns/analysis/DomainAnalysis.ipynb) gives you an idea of what the analysis look like.

### Fetch Google Traffic Data for analysis:

This uses the Google Transparency Report internal API. You must agree to [Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms/).

```
python -m netanalysis.traffic.data.fetch_google_traffic --output_dir=traffic_data/
```

See [netanalysis/traffic/README.md](netanalysis/traffic/README.md) for details.


### Get information about an IP address:

```
python -m netanalysis.ip.ip_info 8.8.8.8
```

### Check if an IP is valid for a domain:

```
python -m netanalysis.tls.domain_ip_validator jigsaw.google.com 172.217.10.78
```
